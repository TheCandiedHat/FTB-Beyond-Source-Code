A Cart Engine is a cart upgrade that can be applied by right clicking it on any cart. When applied, this gives the cart an internal motor, which is powered by any fuel that can be used in a Furnace. Fuel is only used when the cart is in motion. Note that the engine only will be turned on when the cart has enough speed. An initial nudge is required.

Fuel can be inserted manually, by right clicking the cart with a [link{signals:item/rail_configurator}]Rail Configurator[link{}], or automatically, by letting a hopper insert items into the cart like they can do with carts with inventories.

Carts with Cart Engine upgrades are smart, in that they respect Signals and automatically stop for them when they are red. This means that no Powered Rails are needed if all your carts are equipped with a Cart Engine.
