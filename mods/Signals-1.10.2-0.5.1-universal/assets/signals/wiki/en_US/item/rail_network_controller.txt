A Rail Network Controller allows you to monitor your rail networks. Simply right-click the Rail Network Controller.

This is a 2D map view of all the rail networks in the world you are currently in. Note: This is going to be changed, as this would not work well with many/big networks.

Tracks are visualized in gray.
Carts are visualized in blue.
Signals are visualized as their current color (red signals are a red dot, green signals are green).
Station Markers are visualized in yellow.
When carts are routed, part of their path is displayed in a lighter gray.

If you left-click any signal, it will force the signal to turn green, regardless of if it's allowed to. Once a cart passes the signal, the signal will operate normally again.
If you right-click any signal, it will force the signal to turn red. This will stay this way until left-clicked.
